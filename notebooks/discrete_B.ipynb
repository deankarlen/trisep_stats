    "## Discrete Measurement of the mass of a block\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the discrete measurement of the mass of a block using coins and a balance:\n",
    " * We place coins on the balance until the balance tilts, showing that the mass of the coins is greater than the mass of the block. We report the minimum number of coins that exceed the mass of the block.\n",
    " * To ensure that the measurement is reproducible:\n",
    "   * The mass of each coin is an even number of grams\n",
    "   * The mass of the block is an odd number of grams\n",
    "   * The balance is well designed and lubricated. The difference of one gram will always tip the balance towards the more massive side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model #2\n",
    "\n",
    " * some coins are 8 g and some are 10 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    " * Can we report a point estimate for the mass of the block?\n",
    " * What are the confidence and credible intervals for the mass of the block?"
