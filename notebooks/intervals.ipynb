    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the parameter being estimated, with a specified level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the experiment many times, \\[at least\\] 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true mass of the block, \\[no matter what the true mass is\\].\n",

    "A credible interval is a range of values that contains the true value of the parameter with a specified probability, given the observed data. For example, a 95% credible interval means that there is a 95% probability that the true mass of the block lies within that interval, given the observed data and prior information.\n"
